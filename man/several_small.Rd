\title{Example Landscape: Multiple Small Habitat Patches}
\format{
A 15x15 numeric matrix with binary values:
\describe{
  \item{0}{Matrix (non-habitat)}
  \item{1}{Suitable habitat}
}
}
\usage{
several_small
}
\description{
A 15x15 binary landscape matrix representing fragmented habitat with
several small patches of suitable habitat (value = 1) scattered across
a matrix landscape (value = 0).
}
\details{
This landscape demonstrates habitat fragmentation with multiple small,
isolated patches. It is useful for testing:
\itemize{
  \item Population persistence in fragmented landscapes
  \item Dispersal between isolated patches
  \item Metapopulation dynamics
}

The landscape has approximately 22% habitat coverage distributed across
several distinct patches.
